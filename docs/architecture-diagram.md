# Architecture Diagram for Workflow AI Agent

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the Workflow AI Agent application, detailing the system components, their interactions, and the data flow within the application.

## System Components
1. **User Interface (UI)**
   - Web-based interface for user interactions.
   - Allows users to submit requests and view responses.

2. **AI Processing Unit**
   - Core component that processes user requests.
   - Utilizes machine learning models to generate responses.

3. **Data Storage**
   - Database for storing user data, request history, and AI model outputs.
   - Ensures data persistence and retrieval for future interactions.

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Connects the AI Processing Unit with external services (e.g., ticketing systems, notification services).
   - Facilitates data exchange and enhances functionality.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Tracks application performance and user interactions.
   - Provides insights for debugging and improving the AI Agent.

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**
   - Users interact with the UI to submit requests.
   
2. **Request Handling**
   - The request is sent to the AI Processing Unit for analysis.
   
3. **AI Processing**
   - The AI Processing Unit processes the request and generates a response.
   
4. **Data Storage**
   - Relevant data is stored in the database for future reference.
   
5. **Response Delivery**
   - The generated response is sent back to the user via the UI.
