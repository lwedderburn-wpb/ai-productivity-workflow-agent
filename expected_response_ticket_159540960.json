  "suggested_response": "Thank you for reporting the issue with the water as-built polygon fill in the Water Distribution GIS viewer. I understand that the whitish fill inside the pending as-built polygons is obscuring the underlying features, which is affecting your ability to view what's behind the polygon.\n\nThis is a symbology and layer styling issue that can be resolved by adjusting the polygon fill properties. Here's how to address this:\n\n1. **Access Layer Properties**: Open the Water Distribution GIS viewer and locate the pending as-built polygons layer in the layer list.\n\n2. **Modify Fill Symbology**: \n   - Right-click on the layer and select 'Properties' or 'Symbology'\n   - Navigate to the symbology settings for the pending as-built polygons\n   - Change the fill from solid color to 'No Fill' or set transparency to 100%\n   - Keep the outline/border visible with the red color for identification\n\n3. **Alternative Solutions**:\n   - Set fill transparency to 80-90% instead of removing completely\n   - Use a hatched or patterned fill instead of solid\n   - Apply a hollow symbol with just the red outline\n\n4. **Test the Changes**: Verify that underlying features are now visible while the red outline still clearly identifies pending as-built areas.\n\n5. **Apply Changes**: Save the layer symbology and refresh the web viewer to apply changes for all users.\n\nThis modification will maintain the visual identification of pending as-built polygons while allowing you to see the underlying water infrastructure features clearly.",
