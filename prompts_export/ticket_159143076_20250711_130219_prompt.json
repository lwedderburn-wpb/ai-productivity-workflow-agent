    "additional_info": "Additional Information: Hello! We have tried to create a GIS map for the High-Efficiency Toilet Program and had previously encountered some obstacles with address formatting. This program has been ongoing since 2012 and includes a lot of data (addresses) for where the toilets are/should be installed. I have included a copy of the file here for reference. Can you please let me know how to move forward with this? We keep putting it off, but having the map available will be beneficial for the program moving forward. The map should be internal-facing only. Thank you!; Request Type (GIS): Map Request",
